          NSU-CLS software has two parts. One is a web application and another
          is a mobile app. (write about web application). The mobile app has a
          special feature of voice recognition which enables users to lodge a
          complaint via speech instead of text. This feature is particularly
          introduced for the convenience of NSU helpers and staff.
